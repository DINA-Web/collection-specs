# collection-specs
Specifications for the DINA Collection Module.

This repository aim to collect and document the different requirements (what the module should do) and the specifications (how the module should do it). The scope is limited to what the module should do to be DINA compliant and should target a specific implementation/institution.

Requirements/Specifications are recorded as [Issues](https://github.com/DINA-Web/collection-specs/issues).

## Glossary
A [glossary](https://github.com/DINA-Web/collection-specs/blob/master/documentation/glossary.md) is maintained with the definition of terms used in the context of the DINA collection management system.

## Suggested Data Model

## JSON Schemas
This repository will store the [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for the collection module from which an API response could be tested to determine if it is compliant.
